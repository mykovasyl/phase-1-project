# Anime Arena

Anime Arena is a simple SPA fighting game. You can choose from popular anime characters to face off against 5 arena enemies. Powerlevels are generated randomly for the player. 

## Description of game play

You can select one of four characters from a dropdown and give them a description of your choosing. Then it's time to set the power level from 1-100 randomly and enter the Arena. 

In the arena, you will see your enemy, their name, power level and description. When you click the FIGHT button, whose ever power level is higher will be the winner. If the player wins, a new enemy is automatically displayed to continue the fight. If the player loses any fight, they will be taken to the end screen to Try Again.

## Roadmap - Possible future updates

The character you choose from the dropdown does not determine the power level range although a future update could include this functionality. This would give favorable advantage to players who know the characters from watching the animes and would also introduce an element of bias from the creator's perspective as many players would argue which character could naturally beat another. 

A temporary win screen between fights or pop up WIN message. 

More character selection. More enemies (and in random order). 

## Project requirements

This project tested a few coding principles:
Building an HTML page for structure, CSS to organize the layout, and JS for interactivity.
Running an app on a single page without redirects and reloads. 
Fetching data from a created JSON file. 
Listening for events on the page to activate JS interactivity.
Creating if...else statements with for loops. 
Using creativity to solve problems.
